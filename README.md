# Newsweek Clone

## CLone of the Newsweek home page.

Within this repository you will find a somewhat static clone of the [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/), made for the Microverse course, with the additional constraint of using mostly bootstrap classes. 

## Getting started

No live version was deployed so, in order to view the page, you need to clone the repository with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chincoya/newsweek-clone
```

Then, you can run it in any browser that supports flexbox layout and it's properties, as well as JavaScript code, as Bootstrap uses both of them.
